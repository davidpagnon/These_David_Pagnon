\lettrine[lines=1]{S}{ } hould I start this by declaring that these PhD years have been alternatively depressing and engaging, exhausting and stimulating, infuriating and enthralling? This is trite, and true for everyone, PhD student or not. It is true, though, so there it is. Now that it is stated, let me go straight to my acknowledgements.

Above anyone else, I want to thank my mother. She not only had to deal with the difficult task of raising me and putting up with my constant flow of questions, but also with welcoming the four smaller sisters that came after. As a widow. With debts to pay off, and very little money coming in. Moving every two years, until we settled in for a small appartment in a neighborhood that some would call a ghetto, although we prefered calling it home. And yet, there was always food on the table. Even better, we had no idea how poor we were, because she literally sacrificed her life for ours, her passions for our interests. This is quintescential Christlike love. We all had the incredible opportunity of doing at least one physical, and one artistic activity, on top of pursuing university level studies. We also learned how to live happily with very little, which I'm starting to realize is an incredible superpower. Now that I'm a father too, I can measure how high she set the bar, and I can only hope to be half as good as her. Most importantly, she made children that all love each other unconditionally. I can't award her the Legion of Honor she would deserve, but at least here is a little bit of recognition! Thank you from all of us, mom.

I also have a deep thought for my father, who tragically passed away when I was still a little child. He did have to struggle with some issues that would eventually cause his death, but I believe he fought until the very end. He is actually the one who taught me a nice lesson of persistence, surely without even trying. A friend and I were racing up a hill, while my father timed us. I lost, every single time. I went to him and said: "I'm tired papa, can we stop?" "Are you? This is very good news, it means that you're going to get better soon!" I let it sink in for a few moments, and without a word, I went back running. That's when I learned that you have to accept to suffer a little bit in order to make progress. Against all odds, I even made a short professional carrier in sports. Later on, I also realized that out of any bad experience, be it death, you can take out something positive that will make you grow. I am very grateful for both my parents. I am who I am, with all my quirks and all that's to be loved or to be hated, thanks to them.

And thanks to my sisters. And to the rest of our large family, and to my friends. And to all the people I met. And to every little thing I went through. But let's start with the sisters. Esther comes just after me, she married an awesome guy from Congo, and is currently raising two incredible little girls. She is the closest to what my mom was (and still is) with us, welcoming anyone at any time, always on the move, working at nights and taking care of her family during the day, juggling countless tasks and thinking it is all just natural. Then comes Déborah, although she didn't come alone since Joëlla followed 10 minutes later. But believe it or not, she is slightly more than a twin. She has a high sense of justice, which made her switch from studying arts history to working in the health field, so as to be more true to herself. Joëlla also is incredible, she fights every day through her health issues, could not finish high school but still managed to get a bachelor degree, and the to become a professionnal violinist, whose empathy perspires trhough all her plays. I'm on a roll now, and I don't think you'll be suprised if I tell you that my last sister, Noémie, is decent enough. She also became a professionnal violinist, she runs every day, and she is currently studying psychology. A family I'm proud of.

I want to thank my grand-parents, whose house was the ground base for all of my aunts, uncles, and cousins. They made us discover the joy in the pain of exhaustion, through hiking. I can sadly not name every single other member of my family, whether they are human or animal beings, but they are part of myself and I love them all. 

I do need to spend some time for the love of my life, Mikaela. We met in Lebanon, she is American, she cares about France as little as I care about the USA, and yet she accepted to come to France for me, in the armpit of the old and stinky world. She had the courage to take over my mother's difficult job to bear with my incessant questions. She actually has a lot of answers, since the extend of her knowledge is so wide and well-rounded. 

She comes with a very nice family in law, and of course, she is the mother of my child Cédric! An incredible baby who spends all of his energy smiling at every one, all day long. This is a very good way to us get along


He might give me a hard time whenever I need to work, but he does it in a very cute way. 



Editing my English productions, and helps me to improve .




Friends, old ones and new ones. Parkour, church, performing world, other friends I have no idea how I got to know them. Not gonna brag, but they are too numerous to name them all. 

Lab, Lionel saved me from the happy hell of starving performing arts to give me the chance to throw myself in another highly precarious situation. However, in my PhD years, I was priviledged enough to have my cake and eat it too: I had the temporary staibility of earning a fixed salary, and the freedom to go for performance in France and abroad.

Mathieu, quite present and helpful while he lived in the other en of the country.

Thibault, faithful co-bureau. Other interns that filled in this big room full of cameras and otherwise empty of human presence. Other PhD students and members of the lab, who made it a nice place to work. Other colleagues from INSEP (institut national du sport, de l'expertise, et de la performance), LBMC, etc.

These years have been difficult for numerous reasons: Covid and all its consequences of course, period of doubt regarding my skills in research, very difficult situations that some of my close friends and family had to face.

But happy of having overcome it, not only alone but with all of the aforenamed people!

On these words, I believe I can now start writing my thesis.
