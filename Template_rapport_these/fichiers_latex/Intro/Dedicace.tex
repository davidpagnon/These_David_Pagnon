Maman, 5 children alone, move every two years, debts to be paid, and yet not only always food on the table but also sports, artistic activities, and studying. Most importantly, she made children that all love each other unconditionally. Unconditional love, christ-like... 

Father, even though he faced some issues and passed away while a child, only good memories in nature, accept to suffer a little if I want to make progress (would probably not remember this, running uphill and getting beaten every single time by my friend)

Sisters.

Rest of family

Mikaela, love of my life, who accepted to come to France, in the armpit of the old and stinky world. 
Editing my English productions, and helps me to improve .
Family in law.

Also the mother of my child, who gives me a hard time whenever I just get started on work. But he does this in a very cute way.

Friends, old ones and new ones. Parkour, church, performing world, other friends I have no idea how I got to know them. Not gonna brag, but they are too numerous to name them all. 

Lab, Lionel saved me from the happy hell of starving performing arts to give me the chance to throw myself in another highly precarious situation. However, in my PhD years, I was priviledged enough to have my cake and eat it too: I had the temporary staibility of earning a fixed salary, and the freedom to go for performance in France and abroad.

Mathieu, quite present and helpful while he lived in the other en of the country.

Thibault, faithful co-bureau. Other interns that filled in this big room full of cameras and otherwise empty of human presence. Other PhD students and members of the lab, who made it a nice place to work. Other colleagues from INSEP (institut national du sport, de l'expertise, et de la performance), LBMC, etc.

These years have been difficult for numerous reasons: Covid and all its consequences of course, period of doubt regarding my skills in research, very difficult situations that some of my close friends and family had to face.

But happy of having overcome it, not only alone but with all of the aforenamed people!
