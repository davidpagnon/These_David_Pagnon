\section{3D reconstruction}\label{sec:3D reconstruction}

While some approaches only rely on 2D pose estimation to infer 3D pose with another machine learning model, they are generally not considered to be sufficiently reliable. It is, then, important to use the input from several cameras, and to fuse their informations to obtain 3D coordinates.
