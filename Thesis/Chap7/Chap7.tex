\textit{Numerous sports disciplines are practiced with special equipment, such as a board in skateboarding, a racket and a ball in tennis, or a bike in BMX racing. The interactions between the athlete and their gear are often important to retrieve. We analyzed BMX start sequences, by using OpenPose for 2D human pose estimation, and a custom trained DeepLabCut model for bike detection. We ran Pose2Sim on the joint {pilot+bike} 2D estimations, and performed 3D inverse kinematics on a custom OpenSim {pilot+bike} model. This showed that analyzing simultaneously the athlete and their equipment is possible, which provides additional perspectives for markerless sports motion analysis.
