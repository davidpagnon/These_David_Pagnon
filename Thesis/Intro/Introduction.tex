Intérêt markerless dans le sport

Problèmes de détection de features dans image, calibration et triangulation, scaling et cinématique inverse, et où mon travail s'inscrit (bridge between 2D feature detection in computer vision, and physically consistent 3D biomechanics for sports)

Présentation détaillée de chaque chapitre

Schéma résumé: acquisition, calibration, pose estimation, triangulation\&filtrage, scaling, inverse kinematics + applications
