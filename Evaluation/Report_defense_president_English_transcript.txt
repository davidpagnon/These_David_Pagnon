David Pagnon presented his research works in a clear and well illustrated way. His presentation, faithful to the manuscript, highlighted the interdisciplinary side of his work, as well as its wide spectrum.

Through his talk, the jury could appreciate the great amount of his work and the large contribution that consists the publication of an open-source software, easy to use, destined to the biomechanics community on more generally to all the fields interested in movement analysis.

David Pagnon demonstrated, through the numerous questions asked by the jury, his mastery of several domains (learning, computer vision, biomechanics).

For all these reasons, the jury is unanimous and awards him the rank of Doctor of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes.
